# smallReactApps

Small react apps made for training 

You can find every project in separated branches
- listapp: 
this is a simple list-app, you can add the name tabs, or delete them (if tabs <= 2 the text will be red else tabs <= 1 red and bold), 
If you enter something it will log for you out by separated letters with minimal border design and space between. 
Here is only simple css import solution. I made this to train base features, list elements. 


- auth-firebase:
this is an authentication single page app with login/register/password set and reset functions. 
You can ask also for new password for your e-mail adress. 
For the minimal design I used Bootstrap package. 
For the communication Firebase.
